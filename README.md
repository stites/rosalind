Rosalind
=================
"_Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving._"
Much like Project Euler for bioinformatics, Rosalind is a fun way both to learn
a new language as well as an amazingly relevant and exponentially important
field: bioinformatics.

Julia is a language which, I believe, is one of the more interesting ones out
there which some top-notch development going on. Aside from claiming to be
amazingly fast, I am also interested in learning about the development of one of
the newer languagues and studying it's rise (and potential cliff). In short,
I've just heard so many good things about Julia that I couldn't resist getting
my hands dirty.

### About julialang

  |  Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for
  |  technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other
  |  technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler,
  |  distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive
  |  mathematical function library. The library, largely written in Julia
  |  itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed C and Fortran libraries for
  |  linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string
  |  processing. In addition, the Julia developer community is contributing a
  |  number of external packages through Juliaâ€™s built-in package manager at a
  |  rapid pace.
