Counting DNA Nucleotides
========================

### Bioinformatics Notes:

Some cell basics:

 + cells make up all living things
 + the nucleus is in most eukaryotic cells
 + the nucleus is filled with macromolecules called chromatin

on mitosis:

 + mitosis is eukaryotic cell division
 + During mitosis most chromatin condense into long, thin strings called chromosomes.
 + One of these macromolecules contained in chromatin are called nucleic acids.

Nucleic acids!!!

 + Nucleic acids are polymers
 + polymers are repeating chains of smaller, similarly structured molecules (monomers).
 + Nucleic acid polymers are commonly called strands because they are long and thin.
 + The nucleic acid monomer is called a nucleotide and is used as a unit of strand length.
 + One unit is abbreviated to `nt`
 + Each nucleotide has three parts
    - a sugar molecule
    - a negatively charged ion called a phosphate
    - a compound called a nucleobase or "base", for short
