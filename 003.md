The Secondary and Tertiary Structures of DNAclick to collapse
=============================================================

### Bioinformatics Notes:

+ primary structure of a nucleic acid is determined by the ordering of bases.
+ primary structure tells us nothing about 3-dimensional shape.
+ 3-dimensional shape is pretty important (not sure why).

+ discovery of structure was all the rage in the mid-20th Century.
+ James Watson and Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA
+ it was publicized in less than 800 words in Nature (1953)
+ Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling did the high-image X-rays

1. DNA is made up of two strands, running in opposite directions.
2. Each base bonds to a base in the opposite strand.
3. Adenine always bonds with thymine, and cytosine always bonds with guanine
4. the complement of a base is the base to which it always bonds
5. The two strands are twisted together into a long spiral staircase structure called a double helix

+ (1) - (4) compose 'secondary structure'
+ (5) is the 'tertiary structure'

+ bonding of two complementary bases is called a base pair (bp)
+ DNA molecule will commonly be given in bp instead of nt.
+ Bases run in the opposite order to match the fact that the two strands of DNA run in opposite directions.
