The Second Nucleic Acid
========================

### Bioinformatics Notes:

+ RNA is also a nucleic acid! Woah! it also resides in the chromatin.
+ it has a different sugar, called 'ribose' - hence the name.
+ also contains uracil instead of thymine
+ it's a single helix

+ DNA is a blueprint of messenger RNA (mRNA)
+ mRNA is made during RNA transcription

+ In eukaryotes, DNA is in the nucleus and RNA can go anywhere
