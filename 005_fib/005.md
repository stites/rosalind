### Bioinformatics Notes... kinda:

+ Fibonacci's name is _actually_ Leonardo of Pisa and did this thing
  in 1202
+ the fibbonacci sequence came from fibonacci's study of rabbit sex.
+ these were the original assumptions for the population:
  - The population begins in the first month with a pair of newborn
    rabbits.
  - Rabbits reach reproductive age after one month.
  - In any given month, every rabbit of reproductive age mates with
    another rabbit of reproductive age.
  - Exactly one month after two rabbits mate, they produce one male and
    one female rabbit.
  - Rabbits never die or stop reproducing.
+ how many pairs of rabbits would remain in one year?
  - month 1: pair of newborn rabbits.
  - month 2: the first pair of rabbits reach reproductive age and mate. - month 3: new pair of rabbits born. two rabbit pairs. Pair 1 mates
    again.
  - month 4: Pair 1 makes another pair, pair 2 is mature and gets it
    on. three total pairs.
  - year 1: 144 pairs.

What do we have to remember in real life? Rabbits are not immortal, **but** the model is actually pretty good for reproduction in a predator-free environments, i.e. Austrailia. Rosalind tells us about how european rabbits appeared in Australia - mid 19th Century - and within 50 years they eradicated most plant species.

This resulted in lasting changes to the Australian ecosystem. Grasslands were eroded and are still totally screwed over in the outback.
